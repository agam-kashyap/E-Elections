# E-Elections
A web application created using flask and python3 which enables voters to submit their votes online. The voters can view information about the candidates. The candidates can login and modify the information about themselves. Finally the results can be seen in the form of a pie chart. 

## Running Project
Activate the virtual environment
```
cd venv/bin
source activate
```
Then use the command:
```
python run.py
```
On a web browser open the following link:

[Election](http://localhost:8080/)

### If errors faced

I have included the venv file but still if an error pops up saying that the given library isn't installed it can be installed by using 

```
pip install <library name>
```
